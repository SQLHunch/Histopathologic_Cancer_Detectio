# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. The dataset used in this project comes from a Kaggle competition, where the objective is to perform binary image classification to identify whether a patch of tissue contains cancerous cells. This project is part of a mini-project focused on applying deep learning techniques for medical image analysis.

There are no data files due to the size. The data can be download from Kaggle, and the zip file should be on the same folder as the notebook.
